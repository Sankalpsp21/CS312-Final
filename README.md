# Automated Minecraft Server Deployment on AWS with Terraform

This project provides a comprehensive guide and set of scripts to automate the deployment of a Minecraft Java Edition server on an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform. It emphasizes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, enabling consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled deployments.

## Overview

This solution automates the provisioning of necessary AWS infrastructure (EC2 instance, Security Group, Key Pair) and the subsequent configuration of the instance. The configuration includes installing Java, downloading the official Minecraft server JAR, and setting up a `systemd` service. This service ensures the Minecraft server starts automatically on boot and can be managed using standard system commands, facilitating a hands-off setup post-deployment.

## Pipeline Stages

The deployment process follows these distinct stages:

1.  **Local Preparation:**
    * Installation and configuration of required tools (Terraform, AWS CLI).
    * Acquisition or generation of an SSH key pair.
    * Configuration of AWS credentials.

2.  **Infrastructure Definition (Terraform `main.tf`):**
    * The `main.tf` file defines all AWS resources:
        * EC2 Key Pair (`aws_key_pair`) using your public SSH key.
        * Security Group (`aws_security_group`) to allow inbound traffic on SSH (port 22) and Minecraft (port 25565), and all outbound traffic.
        * EC2 Instance (`aws_instance`) using an Amazon Linux 2023 AMI.
    * An AMI data source (`data "aws_ami"`) is used to dynamically fetch the latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMI ID for the specified region.

3.  **Infrastructure Provisioning (`terraform apply`):**
    * Terraform communicates with your AWS account.
    * It creates or updates resources according to the definitions in `main.tf`.

4.  **Instance Configuration (Terraform Provisioners):**
    * Once the EC2 instance is running, Terraform connects to it via SSH (using the provided private key).
    * The `file` provisioner uploads the `scripts/install-minecraft.sh` script to the EC2 instance.
    * The `remote-exec` provisioner executes this script with `sudo` privileges on the instance.

5.  **Output & Verification:**
    * Terraform outputs the public IP address of the newly created Minecraft server.
    * The user can then verify port accessibility using `nmap` and connect to the server using their Minecraft Java Edition client.

## Prerequisites

### Tooling and Versions

Ensure the following tools are installed on your local machine or the VM you'll be using to run Terraform:

* **Terraform:** Version `1.0.0` or newer.
    * Installation: [developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
    * Verify: `terraform version`
* **AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI):** Version `2.0` or newer.
    * Installation: [aws.amazon.com/cli/](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
    * Verify: `aws --version`
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
    * Installation: [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    * Verify: `git --version`
* **SSH Client:** Required by Terraform to connect to the EC2 instance for provisioning.
    * Linux/macOS: Typically pre-installed (OpenSSH).
    * Windows: Modern Windows 10/11 include OpenSSH. Alternatively, Git Bash includes an SSH client.

### AWS Configuration

* **AWS Account:** You need an active AWS account with permissions to create EC2 instances, Security Groups, and Key Pairs.
* **AWS CLI Configuration:** Configure your AWS CLI with credentials. Run `aws configure` and provide your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region (e.g., `us-west-2` as used in this project), and default output format (e.g., `json`).
    ```bash
    aws configure
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    Default region name [None]: us-west-2
    ```

### SSH Key Pair

Terraform will create an `aws_key_pair` resource using your public SSH key. The corresponding private key is needed for Terraform's provisioners to SSH into the EC2 instance.

**Generate a new key pair if needed:**
 * **Linux/macOS or Windows (OpenSSH/Git Bash):**
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/minecraft_key -C "minecraft-key-aws"
     ```

## Deployment Tutorial

These steps guide you through deploying the Minecraft server from your local machine or a VM.

### Step 1: Clone Repository

If you haven't already, clone this repository (or create the files locally based on this guide):
```bash
# Example: git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/minecraft-terraform-aws.git](https://github.com/yourusername/minecraft-terraform-aws.git)
# cd minecraft-terraform-aws
```
### Step 2: Environment Setup Verification
Ensure all tools listed under Prerequisites are installed and correctly configured (especially terraform and aws configure).

### Step 3: Configure SSH Keys
Verify that your SSH public key (~/.ssh/minecraft_key.pub) and private key (~/.ssh/minecraft_key) exist and that the private key has secure permissions (chmod 400). The paths in main.tf must match your key locations.

aws_key_pair.minecraft_key.public_key: file("~/.ssh/minecraft_key.pub")
aws_instance.minecraft.connection.private_key: file("~/.ssh/minecraft_key")
Adjust these paths in main.tf if your keys are named or located differently.

### Step 4: Initialize Terraform
Navigate to the root directory of the project (where main.tf is located) and run:

```bash
terraform init
```
This command initializes your Terraform working directory by downloading the necessary provider plugins (e.g., for AWS).

### Step 5: Validate and Plan Deployment
(Optional) Validate Terraform Configuration:
Check for syntax errors in your Terraform files:

```bash
terraform validate
```

Review Deployment Plan:
See what resources Terraform will create, modify, or destroy before actually making changes:

```bash
terraform plan
```
Review the output carefully.

### Step 6: Apply Terraform Configuration
Execute the deployment:

Resources and Sources
Terraform Documentation:
Terraform AWS Provider
Terraform Provisioners (Note: HashiCorp generally recommends using provisioners sparingly.)
AWS Documentation:
Amazon EC2 User Guide
Amazon Linux 2023
Amazon Corretto
Security Groups for your VPC
Minecraft:
Minecraft Java Edition Server Download (The script uses a direct Mojang Piston Data URL for a specific server version.)
Systemd:
systemd.service â€” Service unit configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```
Terraform will show you the execution plan again and prompt for confirmation. Type yes and press Enter.
